# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description

The Decentralized Voting System is a transparent and tamper-proof platform built on the blockchain to conduct elections securely. It eliminates the need for intermediaries and ensures that each vote is counted fairly.

## Project Vision

To build a secure, accessible, and transparent voting platform using smart contracts, enabling fair elections in any organization, community, or decentralized ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Candidate Initialization**: Candidates are registered at contract deployment.
- **One Address, One Vote**: Ensures fair participation.
- **Vote Counting**: Automatically updates candidate vote counts.
- **Voting Closure**: Only the owner can end the voting process.
- **Public Results**: View real-time candidate data and results.

## Future Scope

- Add anonymous voting using zero-knowledge proofs.
- Integrate off-chain front-end UI for broader accessibility.
- Implement DAO-based result certification or dispute handling.
- Support for vote delegation and weighted voting.
